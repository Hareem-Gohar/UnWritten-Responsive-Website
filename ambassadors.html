            <h2>A Trailblazing Hairdressing Journey</h2>
            <p>Paula Hibbard's story began on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, where she embarked on her hairdressing career as a young teenager with the renowned Jon Le Court hairdressing group. Over the years, she climbed the ladder of success, transitioning from a talented stylist to a skilled salon manager and eventually becoming an area manager for the group in New South Wales. Throughout her journey, Paula explored various roles, including sales and management, but her true passion was ignited during her tenure as a colour technician for the product giant, Goldwell. It was here that she discovered her love for education and inspiring others. <br>
                With an insatiable appetite for knowledge, Paula's talent caught the attention of a leading Australian and International long hair artist and salon owner. This partnership lasted an impressive 15 years, during which Paula traveled the world as a head teacher, delivering classes and bootcamps to hairdressers and salons across the globe. Her dedication and expertise eventually led her to launch her own successful full-time training company, Paula Hibbard Education, in 2014. Today, she spends her days traveling around Australia and internationally, providing bespoke long hair training programs for salons and individuals.</p>
